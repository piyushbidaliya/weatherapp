This is a simple Weather App built with React. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input location.

Features
Search by Location: Users can input a location, and the app will display the current weather data for that location.
Weather Details: The app shows the temperature, weather description, feels-like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Real-time Data: The app fetches real-time weather data when the user presses the Enter key after inputting a location.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
OpenWeatherMap API: Service providing weather data.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd weather-app
Install the required dependencies:
npm install
Start the development server:
npm start

Usage
Enter the location (e.g., city name) into the input field.
Press the Enter key to fetch the weather data for the entered location.
The app will display the current temperature, weather conditions, feels-like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

Code Explanation
State Management: The app uses the useState hook to manage the data and location states.
data: Stores the weather data fetched from the API.
location: Stores the user input for the location.
API Request: The app constructs the API request URL using the user input and makes an HTTP GET request using axios to fetch the weather data.
Conditional Rendering: The app conditionally renders weather data based on the availability of the data object properties.
API Key
Replace the appid parameter in the API URL with your own OpenWeatherMap API key. Sign up at OpenWeatherMap to obtain an API key.
Example:
const url = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${location}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`
